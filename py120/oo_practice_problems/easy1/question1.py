'''
Which one of the following are objects in python?
If they are objects, how can you find our what class they belong to?


1. True
2. 'Hello'
3. [1, 2, 3, 'happy days']
4. 142
5. {1, 2, 3}
6. 1.2345

All Of these are objects and you can find what class they belong to by using the type() method. 
or .__class__ 
or .__class__.__name__

We need parenthesis around the integer because the '.' will lead python thinking 123.k3k is trying to be a float point number.
