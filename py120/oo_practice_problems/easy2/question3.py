What are the benefits of using OOP programming in Python?
1. AS software becomes more complex, OOP helps manage this complexity

2. It lets programmers create containers for data that can be changed and manipualted
without affecting the entire program

3. It lets programmers section off areas of code that perform specific procedures.
This allows their programs to become the interaction of many small parts as opposed to
a massive blob of dependencies

4. We can talk about objects as nouns and their behaviors as verbs.
These distinctions make it easier to conceptualize the structure of an OO program


5. Creating classes and objects lets programmers think about code at
a more abstract level

6. It lets programmers write code that can be used with different kinds of data

7. We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code
