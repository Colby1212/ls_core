Question 1

No it does not return the same thing. The first function
returns 'prop1': "hi there". but the second function just returns None. 
This is because the curly brackets in the second function are on 
a seperate line than return. Therefore the second function simply ignores 
the curly brackets and everything inside and returns None. 

Question 2


I think 
print(num_list) will print [1, 2], and
print(fictionary) will print {'first': [1]}

#LS answer
Since num_list is a reference to the original list in dictionary,
appending to num_list modifies the list! Therefore the dicitonary 
was also updated. 

Question 3

A)
These would print as followed
one is ['one']
two is ['two']
three is ['three']

The variables insides the mess_with_vars function are local variables.
These are shadowing the global variables one, two, and three. The changes to the 
local variables are not reflected when we print one, two, and three outside
of the function. 

B)
Similar to my answer in question 3A, these are local variables inside the function
and so changes made to the local variables are not going to be reflected when we 
print the variables outside of the function. 

C)
These would print 
one is ['two']
two is ['three']
three os ['one']

This is because in the function we aren't reassigning the variables 
to different values but rather directly accessing the lists at index 0.
Because lists are a mutable data type, changes made in the function will be 
reflected outside of the function as well.

def is_dot_seperated_ip_address(input_string):
    dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
    if len(dot_separated_words) != 4:
        return False
    for number in dot_seperated_words:
        if not is_an_ip_number(number):
            return False
        return True
    
    else:
        return False

 I would imagine that the last line would raise a NameError because
 greeting is not defined unless the first block of code is False.
