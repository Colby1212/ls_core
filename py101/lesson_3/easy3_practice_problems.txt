Question 1

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

numbers.clear()

#LS solution ==> 
while numbers:
     numbers.pop()


Question 2

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Question 3

This will print Hello there

Question 4

This will print

"[{"first": 42}, {"second": "value2"}, 3, 4, 5]"

because when we create a copy of the list, a copy of the collections found in indexes 1 and 0 are not copied over as well.
Rather what was copied was that both of these indexes point to a collection. 
The reference was copied but not the actual collection. 
Therefore if we make changes to the collection, they are still reflected in both copies of the list. 
If we want to avoid this, we should create a deep copy of the list using copy.deepcopy(). 
A deep copy will not copy the referemce but copy the collection the pointer is pointing to. 


Question 5

def is_color_valid(color):
    return color == "blue" or color == "green"

#LS solution ==>

def is_color_valid(color):
    return color in ['blue', 'green']
