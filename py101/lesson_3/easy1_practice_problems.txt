Question 1

Yes the code will raise an error because the index 6 is out of range(0, 1, 2).
Trying to access an index not within the range will raise an IndexError error. 


Question 2

If you are looking for True or False you can try using

print(str1.endswith("!"))
print(str2.endswith("!"))
print(str1[-1] == "!")
print(str2[-1] == "!")

Question 3

Here we can try 

famous_words = "seven years ago..."
str1 = f'Four score and {famous_words}'
str1 = "Four score and " + famous_words

Question 4

Here we can try the capitalize() method. 

munster_description = "the Munsters are CREEPY and Spooky."
print(munster_description.capitalize())


Question 5

Here we can use the swapcase() method. 

munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy and spooky."
print(munsters_description.swapcase()) #prints --> tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEP AND SPOOKY

Question 6

If we want to check if "Dino" is in either of the strings we can try 

print("Dino" in str1)
print("Dino" in str2)

Quesiton 7 

We can use the append method.

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Bambam", "Pebbles"]
flintstones.append("Dino")
#["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Bambam", "Pebbles", "Dino"]

Question 8

We can use the .extend method to add Dino and Hoppy to our list. 

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Bambam", "Pebbles"]
flintstones.extend(["Dino", "Hoppy"])

Question 9

Here we can use the .split method and then iteraete through the list and stop when
"house" is the item in the list. 

advice = "Few Things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur"

beginning_of_advice = ''
for words in advice.split():
    if words == "house":
        break
    beginning_of_advice += words + " "

print(beginning_of_advice)

#LS solution --> print(advice.split('house'[0]))

Question 10

advice = "Few Things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur"
print(advice.replace("important", "urgent"))
