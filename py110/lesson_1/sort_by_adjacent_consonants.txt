1. P - Understand the Problem

inputs - List of strings,

outputs - List of strings ordered from highest adjacent consonants to lowest

- What is a consonant? 
- What if we get non-alphabetic characters such as a number?
- How are we sorting the list? from most to least or from least to most?
- When it says they should retain their original order in relation to each other what does this mean?

explicit rules

- if two strings contain the same highest number of adjacent consonants, they should retain their original order in relation to each other.
- Consonants are considered adjacent if they are next to each other in the same word or if there is a space between two consonants in adjacent words.
- sort the list based on the highest number of adjacent consonants a string contains and return the sorted list


implicit rules

- strings may contain more than one word 

2. E - Examples and Test Cases

my_list = ['aa', 'baa', 'ccaa', 'dddaa']
print(sort_by_consonant_count(my_list))
# ['dddaa', 'ccaa', 'aa', 'baa']

my_list = ['can can', 'toucan', 'batman', 'salt pan']
print(sort_by_consonant_count(my_list))
# ['salt pan', 'can can', 'batman', 'toucan']

my_list = ['bar', 'car', 'far', 'jar']
print(sort_by_consonant_count(my_list))
# ['bar', 'car', 'far', 'jar']

my_list = ['day', 'week', 'month', 'year']
print(sort_by_consonant_count(my_list))
# ['month', 'day', 'week', 'year']

my_list = ['xxxa', 'xxxx', 'xxxb']
print(sort_by_consonant_count(my_list))
# ['xxxx', 'xxxb', 'xxxa']


- The list should be sorted from greatest to least 
- no instance of empty strings or non alphabetic characters.
- we are only looking at adjacent consonants, not single ones so 1 and 0 are the same and should remain in the same order 

3. D - Data Structures

Collection of strings that are ordered from most to least adjacent consonants

4. A - Algorithm
Start with a collection of strings
remove all white spaces and check for greatest amount of adjacent consonants
add string to a list depending on how many adjacent consonants there are (how to maintian order)
repeat steps 2 and 3 (loop)
return list with ordered strings

create a function that counts the amount of adjacent consonants
- take a string
- remove white spaces
- replace vowels
- check for most amount of adjacent consonants

5. C - Implement a Solution in Code


def count_max_adjacent_consonants(string):
    string = ''.join(string.split(' '))
    max_consonant_count = 0
    adjacent_consonants = ''

    for letter in string:
        if letter.lower in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvxyz':
            adjacent_consonants += letter
            if len(adjacent_consonants) > max_consonant_count: 
                if len(adjacnet_consonants)> 1:
                    max+consonant_count = len(adjacent_consonants)

        else:
            if leng(adjacent_consonants) > max_consonant_count:
                if len(adjacent_condonants) > 1:
                    max_consonant_count = len(adjacent_consonants)

            adjacent_consonants = ''
        
    return max_consonant_count
